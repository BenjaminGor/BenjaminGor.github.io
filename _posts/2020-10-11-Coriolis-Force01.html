<h2>
    1. The Inertial & Non-Inertial Frame of Reference & the Coriolis force
</h2>

<p>
    [Section 1 & 2 are produced in collaboration with Felix Chiang]
</p>

<p>
    The Coriolis effect creates a lot of weather phenomena, i.e. tropical cyclones, in our Earth. The Coriolis Force, though it is not a real force, drives the moving object to its right in the Northern hemisphere and to its left in the Southern hemisphere. It might look straight-forward at the first glance. Yet, it contains a lot of physics and maths behind. In this Section and Section 2, a qualitative picture will be provided and in the later Sections, mathematical derivations and its application will be discussed.
</p>

<p>
    One can skip this part directly to the Section 2 if one is familiar with the concept of the inertial and non-inertial frames.

<h3>
    1.1. The Inertial and Non-inertial Frame of Reference
</h3>

<p>
    Before we start, do you know that the Earth is rotating on its own? Then, do you feel like you are also rotating even when you are not moving? Indeed, we will not feel anything as we are also rotating along with the Earth, so we are inside a rotating frame and in this situation, it is said that we are in a non-inertial frame. Apart from the non-inertial frame involving acceleration, another frame of reference is the inertial frame which means that it is at rest or non-accelerating. The non-inertial reference frame is a very crucial factor when we talk about the weather, ocean currents and so on as air and seawater also move along with the Earth. And, it is also related to our topic, the Coriolis effect, because the Coriolis force appears only when the object is in motion in a non-inertial frame.
</p>

<p>
    Let us make it explicit how it means by the inertial and non-inertial frame of reference.
</p>

<p>
    The frame of reference is dependent of the observer. Consider an observer, let’s say you, and a frame of reference, let’s say a bus, and an object, let’s say a ball which can move freely in the bus. Now let us look at the following conditions and see which one is an inertial frame and which one is a non-inertial frame. Note that the fictitious forces or the imaginary forces (some texts also call them inertial forces, but this term will not be used in the remaining text to avoid possible confusions) are experienced only when the observers are inside the non-inertial reference frame moving together with the frame.

<h3>
    The following parts are still in constructions.
</h3>

<p>
    1.	A stationary observer inside a stationary frame
</p>

<p>
    2.	A stationary observer outside the stationary frame
</p>

<p>
    Afterwards, the stationary case will be generalized to the constant velocity case, since it is just a special case such that the velocity is zero.
</p>

<p>
    3.	An observer moving with constant velocity inside a frame moving with constant velocity
</p>

<p>
    4.	An observer moving with constant velocity outside the frame moving with constant velocity
</p>
<p>
    5.	An observer moving with constant velocity inside an accelerating frame
</p>
<p>
    6.	An observer moving with constant velocity outside an accelerating frame
</p>
<p>
    7.	An observer is accelerating inside an accelerating frame
</p>
<p>
    8.	An observer is accelerating outside an accelerating frame
</p>
