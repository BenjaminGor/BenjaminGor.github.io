<h2>
    2.	Visualizing the Coriolis Effect Qualitatively
</h2>

<p>
    If you are not familiar with the concept of the concept of the inertial and non-inertial frames, you can return to Section 1.
</p>

<h3>
    2.1. Demonstration of the Coriolis effect
</h3>

<p>
    The video below illustrates the idea of the Coriolis effect. In this video, the two guys throw and catch a ball while sitting on the two ends of a rotating bench in several situations.

</p>

<p>
    In the following two sub-sections, we attempt to show that the Coriolis force is a fictitious force and to see the direction of the Coriolis force. 
</p>

<h3>
    2.2. In the inertial frame of reference
</h3>

<p>
    When the two guys are stationary in the inertial frame of reference (the observer/ camera is not accelerating), the ball is thrown forward in a straight path and it can be caught very easily. It can be clearly seen that there is no extra force exerted on the ball, other than the push.

<p>
    Now, set the two guys in rotation. In this case, the observer is still in the inertial frame since the observer is not in acceleration. When the two guys are rotating in the anti-clockwise direction, one can notice that the ball is still moving in a straight path. Yet, the ball is not caught because the guy moves away from his original position. If the two guys are rotating in the clockwise direction, the ball is again not caught. Since the ball still moves in a straight path, there is no other force exerted on the it, other than the push.

<h3>
    2.3. In the non-inertial frame of reference
</h3>
<p>
    In the non-inertial frame, the camera (the observer) can be thought as it is mounted onto one of the guys. When the two guys are in stationary and not in rotation, the ball thrown follows a straight path and again is caught. In this situation, there is still no extra force exerted on the ball.
</p>
<p>
    Now, the remaining part is in construction.
