    A valuable textbook on elementary Calculus for university entry level, Thomas Calculus is a must-read for ESSC students,
    especially for atmospheric stream students where most of the required courses are mathmatically heavy.
    This book has a well-written structure and illustrated with appropriate diagrams.
    It also conveys the mathmatical concept clearly and are free of typos.
    Example and Exercises are plenty which greatly facilities the learning.
    For the 14th edition, Ch 1 to Ch 10 are mostly suitable for students who are taking MATH1520/MATH1010,
    while Ch 11 and beyond are very useful for MATH2550. This textbook is available online in CUHK library.
