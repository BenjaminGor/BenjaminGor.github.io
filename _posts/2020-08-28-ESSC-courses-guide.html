    Introduction 簡介

<p>
    Planning your timetable and choosing appropriate courses are very important in the University.
    Here we are going to discuss some strategies about enrollment for ESSC students, especially for freshmen.
</p>
<p>
    選擇合適課程以及編排時間表是大學生活重要一環。這篇文章會談及ESSC選課的策略訣竅，希望能幫助到各位新生。
</p>
<h2>
    Preliminary 基礎資訊
</h2>
<p>
    Program information and major/minor requirement can be viewed in CUSIS Academic Records -> Browse Program Information.
    Personal academic requirement and fulfillment status can be checked in CUSIS Academic Progress -> My Academic Requirement.
    Teaching Timetable is available in CUSIS Manage Classes -> Teaching Timetable by Subj/Dpt.
</p>
<p>
    Students can only take up to 18 credits in 1st/2nd semester, and a total of 39 credits in a year. 
    However, it is possible to apply for increase the limits to 21 and 42 respectively.
</p>
<p>
    各項課程資訊可參看上述指示在CUSIS查閱。學生每一主要學期可以修讀最多18學分，一年合計最多39學分。
    特殊情況可申請超額修讀，最多每學期21學分，一年合計最多42學分。
</p>
<p>
    You can put courses into the Shopping Cart for enrollment, 
    in CUSIS, select Manage Classes -> Shopping Cart / Enroll Classes.
    The actual enrollment is also carried out in the same place.
    When selecting courses, the Waitlist box should always be checked to be placed in the queue if the class is full.
    Bear in mind that you should always verify in the Shopping Cart after picking the courses, 
    by ticking all of them and click Verify, to make sure there are no time clashes or other problems.
</p>
<p>
    學生可以用購物車功能選定想修讀的課堂，真正註冊時也是在同一頁進行。
    選擇時記住要勾選等候隊列以防滿額。
    選完後也要使用確認功能檢查有否時段衝突。

    If you are directly admitted to ESSC through JS4633, then you will be pre-registered this course. 
    Potential ESSC students may also be pre-registered. But nothing stops you from dropping during the add/drop period.
    The course is closely packed with many content, mainly about atmospheric physics, atmospheric chemistry, ecosystem.
    The difficulty depends a lot on your background. 
    Students who are good with physics, chemistry and mathematics will find this course manageable.
    While students lacking a good science background may feel overwhelming.
    However, I believe that students without a strong science background can still survive this course.
    The mathematics used is mainly basic algebra, those like calculus are only for reference.
    When dealing with tests, knowing what formula to use and careful number substitution will suffice.
    Some concepts may be new, but understanding them are not hard.
    It will be the first major course for many, and hence the earlier you finish this, 
    the earlier you can unlock other more advanced courses in the atmospheric stream.
    However, it is still viable to study this in Year 2, after building a strong foundation from faculty packages.
    It is also a chance for you to get a feel of studying in ESSC.

    直入和潛在地科學生會直接被預先註冊ESSC2020，不過之後可以退選。
    本科內容豐富，主要有大氣物理及化學、和生態系統。
    難易度因人而異，數底/物理底好者大多輕鬆通過。
    沒有科學背景會比較辛苦，但依然可以捱過。
    所用數學不難，大多是代數，難的數都不會考，考試知道用哪條方程，小心代入就可以了。
    反而有些物理概念一開始不太容易消化。
    這是第一個地科課程，愈早處理愈好，未來可以選擇提早修更高級的課程。
    不過二年級讀完學院基礎課程才讀ESSC2020也不是大問題。
    另一個一年級就修的好處是讓你感受唸地科是怎樣一回事。
