<h2>
    Installing R and RStudio
</h2>

<p>
    R can be obtained from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">the official website</a>. 
    Choose the download page corresponding to your operating system and find the latest version.
    For Windows user, select base and download the newest version.
    For Mac user, simply download the package file of the newest version.  
</p>

<p>
    We also want to download RStudio for an enhanced interactive editor and interface.
    It can be acquired <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download">here</a>.
    For our purposes, picking the free RStudio Desktop is enough.
</p>

<p>
    After successful installation of R and RStudio, launching RStudio will look like this.

<h2>
    Running your first command and script
</h2>

<p>
    To run any command, we can directly type in the console prompt indicated by the blue > sign.
    For demonstration purpose, we run the simplest command 
    <code>print()</code>
    where inside the parenthesis we provide the string to be printed.
</p>

<p>
    We can also pack all the codes into a script to be executed at once.
    To do so, we create a new script from the tool bar as follow.
</p>

<p>
    Now we try again to do a print statement.
    Save and run the script by clicking on the respective buttons.
    As expected, it should give the same outcome as when we directly enter in the console prompt.
