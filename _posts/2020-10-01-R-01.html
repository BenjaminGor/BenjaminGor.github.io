<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    This article will describe the commonly used object types in R, and their respective operations.

<h2>
    Variables, Objects and Assignment
</h2>

<p>
    In R, we deal with different objects, like numbers, vectors and matrices. 
    Making reference to such objects required assigning them to a variable that can be manipulated later.
    To do so, we will use the assignment operator <code> <- </code> 
    where the left hand side is the variable name and the right hand side is the object.
    The figure below demonstrates the assignment and printing of a number.

<h2>
    Basic Mathematical Operations
</h2>

<p>
    Basic mathematical operations, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,
    can be done by <code> + </code>, <code> - </code>, <code> * </code>, <code> / </code>, 
    between numbers or variables. Exponentiation can be done by <code> ** </code>, or
    in the format of scientific notation <code> e+ </code> and <code> e- </code>.
    The results of mathematical operations can also be assigned to a variable.
    The example below shows the results of mathmetical operations on some numbers.

<h2>
    Vectors and Related Operations
</h2>

<p>
    We also have objects representing vectors and matrices in R.
    To create a vector, use <code> c() </code> with the entries as input, where c stands for column.
    A convenient way to create a sequence of numbers within a range is to use <code> : </code>,
    with a step of 1. This is useful in constructing a vector.
    Mathematical operators acting between two vectors are element-wise, applied each pair by each pair. 
    Meanwhile mathmatical operations between a vector and a single number will have the effect of
    applying the operator on all entries in that vector against the scalar.
    Those behaviors are demonstrated below.
