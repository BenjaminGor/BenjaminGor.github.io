    Currently a undergraduate student from ESSC Atmospheric Stream, CUHK. 
    He is not one of the major authors of the Handbook for ESSC students, responsible for most of the writings.
    He is just a bit familiar with atmospheric physics, applied mathematics and programming. 
    Also, he does not like teaching very much but unfortunately does not speak very well.
    Students are welcomed to consult him about studying in ESSC.
